# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :warning: **I now work on something completely different! I'm no longer maintaining the hosted projects, but they're still available as an archive. Feel free to use and modify!** (any archived info may no longer be valuable)
- :sparkles: I am a very unique original hacker (not true, am just da GX gamer)
- :computer: I know some coding languages: mostly HTML/CSS, and a bit of JS/Python
- :art: I have an archive of [Discord themes](https://github.com/gx-hacker/discord-themes) and [browser styles](https://github.com/gx-hacker/browser-styles) from [GXH Projects](https://github.com/gh-hacker/home).
- :left_speech_bubble: My main pronouns are they/them but I don't mind he/she/any but whatever... this is gender 5hit and I don't understand why there are 500 pronouns for 1 species: humans. And what makes it more senseless is that it's only for 3rd person use.

## GXH Projects Archive

Check pinned repositories! If you'd still like to visit, I suggest you to start by the [Home](https://github.com/gx-hacker/home) repository before anything else.
